# WordPress React Integration Starter

This repository provides a starter template for integrating a React application into a WordPress theme. It uses Vite for development and build processes, React for the frontend, and a centralized `mount-points.json` for consistent React mount point IDs across PHP and JavaScript.

## üöÄ Features

- **React with Vite**: Modern frontend development with hot module reloading (HMR) and optimized builds.
- **Dynamic Mount Points**: Centralized `mount-points.json` ensures React components are mounted in the right places.
- **Separate Bundles**: Optimized, page-specific JavaScript bundles for faster loading.
- **WordPress Theme**: Includes standard WordPress templates with React integration.
- **Clean Structure**: Organized directories for WordPress (`wordpress-theme`) and React app (`react-app`).
